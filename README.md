# GitGroupExercise
Group: Simulation/workshop activity for Git & GitHub Desktop.
o	Instructions (General): Trainees will be divided into groups (4 members). Each group will be given a Git repo. The group's objective is to debug all of the functions in the main branch prior to the release.
o	Guide:
1.	Each member of the group will create their own feature-branch. 
2.	Members will debug a function assigned to them on their newly created branch.
3.	Note: Ensure that members push any significant changes from their feature branch before merging it with the development branch.
4.	Once completed, members will merge their feature branch into the development branch. 
5.	The group leader will validate the functionality of each function from the development branch.
6.	After the group leader has completed his or her validation, the group leader will give the member heads up when to merge their branch to the release branch.
7.	Each member will submit a report that includes (name of the function assigned to them, any changes made, code versions, branch name.)
8.	Group leader will consolidate each member’s reports.
 
o	Deliverables:
1)	Release branch.
2)	Report.
